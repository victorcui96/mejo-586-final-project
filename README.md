# Obamacare Data App
Final Project for Steven King's MEJO class, taken in fall 2016. It's a news app about Obamacare designed to educate individuals about the health care plan.

It makes use of the Twitter, Google Maps, and NY Times APIs. It uses a PHP API (https://github.com/J7mbo/twitter-api-php) to authenticate the Twitter API. It also uses the fullPage.js library for design.
